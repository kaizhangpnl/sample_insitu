create_latlon.ncl : create latlon information file latlon.nc 

sample.ncl : sample model data at given lat/lon 
             all variables in the history file will be sampled at given locations 

             the output variables will have dimensions like [time, station_index] or [time, lev, station_index] 

             the station index is put into the rightest dimension so that we can use CDO to process the data.
